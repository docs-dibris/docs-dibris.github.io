## Motivation and goals

We are glad to announce the 5<sup>th</sup> edition of the Computer Science Workshop at the Department of Informatics, Bioengineering, Robotics and System Engineering (DIBRIS) at Università di Genova.

### What about research in Computer Science?

Computer Science is constantly increasing in complexity with many and many new fields of research emerging.  
Here, at the University of Genoa, we are involved in some of these fields as Virtual and Augmented Reality, Multi-Agent systems, Data Science, Data Management, Computer Graphics, Security, Machine Learning, Programming Languages, Logic, Computer Vision, Software Engineering and many others. 
The main goal of the workshop is discussing the many aspects of the Computer Science research fields, to present a broad perspective of this subject and look for possible (unexpected) interconnections. 

We are glad to host six speakers

 - [Piotr Falizewski](https://home.agh.edu.pl/~faliszew/), AGH University of Science and Technology, Krakow
 - [Giovanni Maria Farinella](https://web.dmi.unict.it/docenti/giovanni.maria.farinella), University of Catania
 - [Michael Fisher](https://personalpages.manchester.ac.uk/staff/michael.fisher/), University of Manchester
 - [Mikhail Fominykh](https://www.ntnu.edu/employees/mikhail.fominykh), Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Trondheim
 - [Daniela Giorgi](), National Research Council - Institute of Information Science and Technologies, Pisa
 - [Marco Polignano](https://scholar.google.it/citations?user=sjQSYGQAAAAJ&hl=it), University of Bari

plus a special guest

 - [Moreno Razzoli](https://morrolinux.it/), morrolinux.it
