## Motivation and goals

We are glad to announce the 5<sup>th</sup> edition of the Computer Science Workshop at the Department of Informatics, Bioengineering, Robotics and System Engineering (DIBRIS) at Università di Genova.

### What about research in Computer Science?

Computer Science is constantly increasing in complexity with many and many new fields of research emerging.  
Here, at the University of Genoa, we are involved in some of these fields as Virtual and Augmented Reality, Multi-Agent systems, Data Science, Data Management, Computer Graphics, Security, Machine Learning, Programming Languages, Logic, Computer Vision, Software Engineering and many others. 
The main goal of the workshop is discussing the many aspects of the Computer Science research fields, to present a broad perspective of this subject and look for possible (unexpected) interconnections. 

We are glad to host six speakers

 - [Marco Polignano](https://scholar.google.it/citations?user=sjQSYGQAAAAJ&hl=it), University of Bari
 - [Piotr Falizewski](https://home.agh.edu.pl/~faliszew/), AGH University of Science and Technology, Krakow
 - [Mikhail Fominykh](https://www.ntnu.edu/employees/mikhail.fominykh), Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Trondheim
 - [Giovanni Maria Farinella](https://web.dmi.unict.it/docenti/giovanni.maria.farinella), University of Catania
 - [Michael Fisher](https://personalpages.manchester.ac.uk/staff/michael.fisher/), University of Manchester
 - [Daniela Giorgi](), National Research Council - Institute of Information Science and Technologies, Pisa

plus a special guest

 - [Moreno Razzoli](https://morrolinux.it/), morrolinux.it

Marco is an Assistant Professor in the computer science department at the University of Bari Aldo Moro, Italy, and a key member of the SWAP research group. 
He constantly contributes to cutting-edge AI, NLP, and Recommender Systems advancements. 
In 2018, he obtained a Ph.D. with a doctoral thesis titled "An affect-aware computational model for supporting decision-making through recommender systems". 
He served as a program committee member for several international conferences, including IJCAI, IUI, RecSys, and WWW. 
He served as an organizer for many workshops and has been among the chairs for the ACL 2021, EACL, and EMNLP 2024. 
He was part of the prestigious Marie Skłodowska-Curie (MSCA-RISE) fellowship program in 2016 and 2018. 
Recently, he actively worked on the FAIR (Future AI Research) national project. 
Within this context, he worked on LLaMAntino (https://chat.llamantino.it/), an LLM for the Italian language. He is responsible for the "User Preferences and Personalization" task of the FAIR Transversal Project TP2 - Vision, Language, and Multimodal Challenges.
