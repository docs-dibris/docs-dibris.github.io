## Motivation and goals

The DoCS group is pleased to announce that the 5<sup>th</sup> edition of the Computer Science Workshop will be held on <b>September 9 and 10, 2024<b> at the Department of Informatics, Bioengineering, Robotics and System Engineering (DIBRIS) at the University of Genoa.

Computer Science is a vast field of ever-increasing complexity, with new and exciting research challenges emerging at all times.
Here at the University of Genoa we are involved in active areas of research such as Virtual and Augmented Reality, Multi-Agent systems, Data Management, Geometric Modeling, Security, Machine Learning, Programming Languages, Logic, Computer Vision, Software Engineering, Artificial Intelligence and more. 

Every year, the Workshop provides its attendees with a broad perspective on the state of research in Computer Science, both at our department and abroad. It is an opportunity for students to connect with the research world, and for researchers to discover unexpected connections.

## Keynotes
This year's edition will feature six keynotes by distinguished researchers from Italian and foreign Universities:

 - [Piotr Falizewski](https://home.agh.edu.pl/~faliszew/), AGH University of Science and Technology, Krakow
 - [Giovanni Maria Farinella](https://web.dmi.unict.it/docenti/giovanni.maria.farinella), University of Catania
 - [Michael Fisher](https://personalpages.manchester.ac.uk/staff/michael.fisher/), University of Manchester
 - [Mikhail Fominykh](https://www.ntnu.edu/employees/mikhail.fominykh), Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Trondheim
 - [Daniela Giorgi](), National Research Council - Institute of Information Science and Technologies, Pisa
 - [Marco Polignano](https://scholar.google.it/citations?user=sjQSYGQAAAAJ&hl=it), University of Bari

as well as a talk by a very special guest:

 - [Moreno Razzoli](https://morrolinux.it/), morrolinux.it

## Local Companies
As every year, the Workshop gives participants the opportunity to connect with local companies doing active research in Computer Science. Company employees will present challenging problems they encountered on their job, and the solutions they developed to tackle them.

Companies will also setup informative booths during lunch of the second day of the event.

<i>The list of companies has not yet been finalized.</i>

TBD

## PhD Poster Session
During lunch of the first day of the event, all Computer Science PhD students will have a poster session to present their work to participants and speakers.

## Additional information
Participation is free of charge and open to everyone, but registration is required.
Links for registration will be provided soon.

Lunch and coffee breaks will be offered to all participants.
