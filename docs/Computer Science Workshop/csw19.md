## Motivation and goals

We are glad to announce the 1<sup>st</sup> edition of the Computer Science Workshop at the Department of Informatics, Bioengineering, Robotics and System Engineering (DIBRIS) at  Università di Genova.

### What about research in Computer Science?

Computer Science is constantly increasing in complexity with many and many new fields of research emerging.  Here, at the University of Genoa, we are involved in some of these fields as Virtual and Augmented Reality, Multi-Agent systems, Data Science, Computer Graphics, Security, Machine Learning, Programming Languages, Logic, Computer Vision, Software Engineering and many others. The main goal of the workshop is discussing the many aspects of the Computer Science research fields, to present a broad perspective of this subject and look for possible (unexpected) interconnections. We are glad to host four speakers:

- __Ugo Dal Lago__, Università di Bologna;
- __Rafael Bordini__, Pontifícia Universidade Católica do Rio Grande do Sul;
- __Battista Biggio__, Università di Cagliari;
- __Georg Gottlob__, Oxford University and TU Vienna.

The presentations are aimed at providing an international view of a wide range of research topics in Computer Science. The workshop includes a lunch offered to the participants, during which all the PhD students in Computer Science are going to present their work. It is a nice opportunity for discussing, sharing new ideas, and more generally networking.

## Abstracts

### _How to Write Introductions, and Why Research Projects Matter_ - Georg Gottlob

Research results are a mind products. First and foremost, such products need to be of very good quality. However, in our times of information overflow, even the most excellent research products need marketing and "sales" promotion in order to be adequately considered by the Scientific Community. This includes publication in a suitable venue, and an effective "sales pitch" in the introduction. Moreover,  research often needs further resources and thus project funding. Why is funding so important for a young researcher?
This lecture will address all these issues. First, I will reveal a couple of secrets about how to write a convincing introduction, then  I will make a few considerations about project funding that may eventually turn out to be useful to you. These topics will be partially covered only. However, I hope that the essentials I will talk about might still be beneficial to you, providing therewith a positive interpretation and context for the Latin half-phrase "...semper aliquid haeret".  

### _Wild Patterns: Ten Years after the Rise of Adversarial Machine Learning_ - Battista Biggio

Data-driven AI and machine-learning technologies have become pervasive, and even able to outperform humans on specific tasks. However, it has been shown that they suffer from hallucinations known as adversarial examples, i.e., imperceptible, adversarial perturbations to images, text and audio that fool these systems into perceiving things that are not there. This has severely questioned their suitability for mission-critical applications, including self-driving cars and autonomous vehicles. This phenomenon is even more evident in the context of cybersecurity domains with a clearer adversarial nature, like malware and spam detection, in which data is purposely manipulated by cybercriminals to undermine the outcome of automatic analyses. As current data-driven AI and machine-learning methods have not been designed to deal with the intrinsic, adversarial nature of these problems, they exhibit specific vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit either to mislead learning or to evade detection. Identifying these vulnerabilities and analyzing the impact of the corresponding attacks on learning algorithms has thus been one of the main open issues in the research field of adversarial machine learning, along with the design of more secure and explainable learning algorithms. In this talk, I review previous work on evasion attacks, where malicious samples are manipulated at test time to evade detection, and poisoning attacks, which can mislead learning by manipulating even only a small fraction of the training data. I discuss some defense mechanisms against both attacks in the context of real-world applications, including computer vision, biometric identity recognition and computer security. Finally, I sketch some promising future research directions.

### _Differential Program Semantics_ - Ugo Dal Lago

Giving meaning to programs through axiomatic, denotational, and operational semantics is one of the main goals of theoretical computer science since its early days. Traditionally, program semantics is built around notions of program equivalence and refinement, based on which verification and transformation techniques can be justified. More and more often, however, programs are substituted with approximately equivalent programs, or verified against imprecise specifications. Program semantics has started dealing with program differences only in recent years, through the interpretation of programs in metric spaces. We give a brief survey about the state of the art on metric program semantics, and on the inadequacy of metrics as a way to deal with program differences. We thus point at a few preliminary results on a new kind of differential program semantics, which a just-launched ERC project plans to investigate along four axes: logical relations, bi-similarity, game semantics, and linear logic.
 
### _Towards Using Agent Programming Enriched with Ontologies and Argumentation for Developing Chatbots_ - Rafael Bordini

In this talk, I will briefly overview the work on a platform for the development of multi-agent systems called JaCaMo. I will then discuss recent work on the integration of Argumentation Theory into that programming platform. Previous work on using Ontological Reasoning in the context of that platform will also be presented. I will then introduce recent work on a chatbot that supports hospital staff in doing bed allocation. To conclude, I will discuss future directions on the combination of both technologies and the impact they could have to the development of intelligent chatbots.
