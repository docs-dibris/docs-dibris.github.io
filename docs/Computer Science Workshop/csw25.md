## Motivation and goals

The DoCS group is pleased to announce the 6th edition of the Computer Science Workshop (CSW), which will take place on May 29th and 30th, 2025, at the DIBRIS (Valletta Puggia) campus of the University of Genoa.

Computer Science is a rapidly evolving field, constantly driven by innovation and interdisciplinary challenges. At the University of Genoa, our department is active in a wide range of research areas, including Virtual and Augmented Reality, Multi-Agent Systems, Data Management, Geometric Modeling, Cybersecurity, Machine Learning, Programming Languages, Logic, Computer Vision, Software Engineering, Artificial Intelligence, and more.

The annual Computer Science Workshop is a key moment for our community to share ideas, present ongoing research, and foster collaborations. This year, we chose to maintain the successful two-day format introduced in last year’s edition, while also introducing new types of activities alongside the traditional keynote talks. These additions are meant to bring a fresh perspective to the event, encourage greater interaction, and keep the program diverse and engaging for all participants.

The Workshop remains a valuable opportunity for students to get in touch with cutting-edge research and for researchers to explore new connections—within and beyond the boundaries of their own fields. However, this year’s edition pays special attention to Master's students, with the aim of encouraging their engagement with the world of research and the department’s ongoing activities. Students interested in obtaining AUK credits for attending the event can find all the relevant information in [the dedicated section](#additional-useful-knowledge-auk-credits-for-master-students).

You can register by clicking on the button under the CSW logo at the top of the page, or on [this link][registration].

Lunch and coffee breaks will be offered to all participants.

## Additional Useful Knowledge (AUK) credits for Master Students
This year’s edition has also been designed with a special focus on Master's students, with the goal of bringing them closer to the world of research—both in general and with particular attention to the work carried out by the department’s research groups, faculty members, and PhD students.

To this end, students whose study plan includes the acquisition of AUK credits will be eligible to receive 2 AUK credits for participating in the event.

Students will be required to demonstrate their attendance, and credits will be awarded only to those who attend all activities, with the exception of at most one session. Participation in the debate is mandatory.

After the event, eligible students will be notified via email regarding the proper registration of the acquired credits.
