## Motivation and goals
The DoCS group is pleased to announce the sixth edition of the Computer Science Workshop (CSW), which will take place this year on May 29th and 30th at the Valletta Puggia building of the DIBRIS department, at the University of Genoa.

Computer Science is a rapidly evolving field, constantly driven by innovation and interdisciplinary challenges. At the University of Genoa, our department is active in a wide range of research areas, including Virtual and Augmented Reality, Multi-Agent Systems, Data Management, Geometric Modeling, Cybersecurity, Machine Learning, Programming Languages, Logic, Computer Vision, Software Engineering, Artificial Intelligence, and more.

The annual Computer Science Workshop is a key moment for our community to share ideas, present ongoing research, and foster collaborations. This year, we chose to maintain the successful two-day format introduced in last year’s edition, while also introducing new types of activities alongside the traditional keynote talks. These additions are meant to bring a fresh perspective to the event, encourage greater interaction, and keep the program diverse and engaging for all participants.

The Workshop remains a valuable opportunity for students to get in touch with cutting-edge research and for researchers to explore new connections—within and beyond the boundaries of their own fields. However, this year’s edition pays special attention to Master's students, with the aim of encouraging their engagement with the world of research and the department’s ongoing activities. Students interested in obtaining AUK credits for attending the event can find all the relevant information in [the dedicated section](#additional-useful-knowledge-auk-credits-for-master-students).

### Keynote - _Evaluating (quality of) user experiences with immersive technologies_ by __Jesús Gutiérrez__
- **Start time:** 2:30 PM
- **Duration:** 1 hour
- **Location:** Room 505, 5th floor

#### Abstract
The emergence of immersive media technologies is providing to the users new interactive experiences, which allow a more natural and complete exploration of the represented content in comparison with previous audiovisual technologies.
These innovative solutions entail novel perceptual and technical factors that should be extensively studied to support an adequate and inclusive development of technology so it meets the expectations and demands of all users.
In this sense, this talk provides an overview on the evaluation of the quality of user experiences with immersive technologies, primarily by subjective tests.
Specifically, a set of examples will be presented, covering the evaluation of different use cases of immersive technologies with different level of interaction (e.g., 360-degree video, virtual reality, immersive communications, etc.).

### Keynote - _AI for All? Navigating Ethical Frontiers in Artificial Intelligence_ by __Annalisa Barla__
- **Start time:** 9:45 AM
- **Duration:** 1 hour
- **Location:** Room 505, 5th floor

#### Abstract
Artificial intelligence promises to revolutionize our world, but as AI systems become deeply embedded in our lives – deciding who gets a loan, diagnosing diseases, or shaping our news – critical ethical questions arise.
This talk moves beyond surface-level discussions of bias in algorithms to confront the deeper, often invisible, ethical challenges of real-world AI deployment.
We'll explore how bias manifests not just in data, but in the very processes of annotation and representation, revealing the limitations of current techniques and illustrating how regulations may fix that.

#### Abstract
As humans, our 3D perception of the world is as natural as crucial.
Understanding spatial relations, finding differences and similarities, and interacting with objects is at the core of almost every daily activity.
But how can such intelligence be coded into a computer? With recent technological advances in 3D shape acquisitions and processing, the Computer Vision, Graphics, and Artificial Intelligence fields look for methods and representations that ease the reasoning on this structured data.
Developing systems that perceive the physical world as we do would be terrific for all sorts of applications, from medicine to entertainment, from archeology to social humanities.
But reasoning about geometry is not just about objects -- it is also about us. At the time of virtual and augmented reality, understanding 3D data is fundamental for a fair and comprehensive representation of our digitized identities.
In this lecture, we will introduce the core ideas for working with geometrical information, discussing its role in (geometrical) deep learning, and provide the audience with code to visualize and process 3D data.

#### Abstract
In this hands-on session, you'll dive into biomedical signals that are primarily encountered in non-clinical applications, such as human-computer interfaces, neuromarketing, and biofeedback.
We'll begin by refreshing the fundamentals of signal analysis, including Fourier analysis and sampling.
Then, using a case-study approach, we'll process common biomedical signals, aiming to uncover the main traps and the tricks to overcome them.
We'll also explore how one signal can be derived from another by exploiting the interrelations between physiological systems.
Due to practical considerations and time constraints, we will mainly focus on electrophysiological signals (ExG).
This journey will start in the time domain and move into the frequency and Z domains.
We will use MATLAB to design and apply signal analysis and processing techniques.
